# Materials Data Model 

The IMQCAM data management platform implements a material-centric data model
based on [GEMD](https://citrineinformatics.github.io/gemd-docs/) (Graphical
Expression of Materials Data). GEMD models and links four basic components: 
materials, ingredients, processes, and characterizations. This allows us to
represent the complete materials research lifecycle. GEMD provides a further
distinction between _intent_ (e.g., the specification of an activity) and
_realization_ (e.g., the actual activity). The graph-based material history
"links together materials, the processes that produced them and the
measurements that characterize them."
