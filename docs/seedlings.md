# Seedling Profiles

To facilitate requirements analysis and data management system design, detailed
profiles are developed for each seedling.  

Seedling profiles are developed based on a combination of documentation review
and interviews with seedling researchers and data representatives.  For more 
information about profile development process, see the [Case Studies](case-studies-doc) section.

Cooperating seedlings include:
* [JHU/UCSB Seedling](seedling-jhu)
* [TAMU Seedling (BIRDSHOT)](seedling-tamu)
* [Purdue/Northwestern Seedling](seedling-northwestern)
