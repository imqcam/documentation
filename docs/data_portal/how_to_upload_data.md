## Uploading and Downloading Data

The PARADIM Data Portal is the central resource for you to find data from our PARADIM project. Experimental data is centralized here by automated, streaming upload from PARADIM labs but you can also manually upload or download your data for your project. While your project data is private until publication you can access the working data through either the graphical interface or programmatic APIs at any time.  Note that data in the PARADIM portal is read-only. That is, it is considered data record and you cannot edit or otherwise modify the data files here. You can complete control, however, to modify metadata and you can create a derivative dataset that you hold here if you need to incorporate changes such as a new correction.
