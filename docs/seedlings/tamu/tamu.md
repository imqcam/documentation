This profile is still under development.  The information provided in this
profile is based on {cite:ps}`Arroyave_2022,BIRDSHOT_2022` and interviews with
BIRDSHOT team members.

Overview of the BIRDSHOT collaborative workflow
```

## Collaboration
The BIRDSHOT seedling is a collaboration between eight different teams from
four institutions. The collaborative workflow is illustrated in
{numref}`birdshot-collab-fig`. This is an iterative process.

* Alloy search and design 
  * High-throughput design [Arr√≥yave, TAMU]
* Processing:
  * Vacuum arc melting (VAM) [Karaman, TAMU]
  * Directed energy deposition (DED) [Vecchio, UCSD]
* Characterization:
  * Tension [Karaman, TAMU]
  * High strain rate nanoindentation (HSR-NI) [Pharr, TAMU]
  * Laser induced projectile impact testing (LIPIT) [Thomas, TAMU]
  * Spherical indentation [Kalidindi, GT]
* Data-driven models [Srivastava, TAMU]
* Optimization [Allaire, TAMU]

## Data management

The BIRDSHOT seedling uses a shared filesystem approach for data management via
Google Drive. Information is organized according to a well-defined filesystem
hierarchy and naming conventions. The team is working with Contextualize to
automate curation, collection and analysis workflows.

Filesystem organization and naming conventions (DED)
```

* Unique code: AAA, AAB, AAC
* Fabrication method: VAM, DED
* Production batch: <unique code>01-n (VAM is single sample, DED is 8 samples on
  a single sample holder)
* Location and sample number:
* Process: HSR, NI, LIPIT, Spherical indentation, tension, SEM, XRD, EBSD, EDS

### Data summary

Data is organized in the shared folder under three primary folders. Below is a
summary of data types in each folder:
* `/data/`:
  * NI: nmd, nmdproj, txt
  * SEM: tiff
  * Carta: json
  * Other: xlsx
* `/FeCoCrNiV - Synthesis Sub Project`
  * EDS/EBSD: bmp, dat, tiff
  * XRD: hdf5, rasx, scn
  * BBO: m, mat
  * Other: csv, png, pptx, py, xslx
* `/Sample Data`:
  * EDS/EBSD: dat, tiff
  * XRD: bmp, par, raw, scn
  * BBO: m, mat
  * Other: csv, pdf, png, ppty, py, tra, txt, xslx

Compiled results and summary tables are generally provided in Excel
spreadsheets, however work is being done with the Contextualize data seedling to
use custom web-based forms with JSON output stored in the same folder
structure. Other types of research assets are present (NI, XRD, EBSD data;
source code), but according team members, many research assets are maintained by
individual labs or researchers and only summary results shared in Drive.

## Alloy search and design

The alloy search and design process centers on BO for the compositional space.
The basic workflow is as follows:

* Candidate alloys are sent to the team from the two processing routes (VAM or
  DED) with production job travelers. Each iteration has a unique sample
  identifier.
* Preliminary characterization
* For each iteration, summary results are provided in Excel to BO team
* Bayesian optimization (Matlab)
  * Objectives: hardness, ultimate tensile strength/yield strength (UTS/YS), strain rate sensitivity
  * 60 experiments per iteration, 3 objectives, executed on TAMU supercompute.
  * 8 samples each from Low and High stacking fault energy (SFE)
  * Original runtime of 42 hours with 400 cores has been reduced to ~1 hour
* Alloy search across constrained compositional space


## Synthesis and bulk property characterization

* Target property data informs materials design
* Batch material production
* Thermomechanical processing
* Microstructural property characterization 
  * Microstructure and homogeneity evaluation (XRD)
  * Chemical analysis (EDS)
* Mechanical property characterization
  * Microhardness
  * Tension

## Rapid experimental alloy development

## High throughput characterization

### Nanoindendation

Workflow:
* Receive samples from fabrication team
* Obtain elastic modulus and preliminary hardness
* High strain rate testing using HSR nanoindenter
* Optical profiling of indents to determine degree of pile-up or sing-in
* Pile-up/sink-in correction
* Submit data to computational team and deliver samples to LIPIT group

summary spreadsheets.
