# Porosity Modeling

This framework models porosity in L-PBF metal parts, simulating lack-of-fusion, keyhole, and gas porosity mechanisms. It integrates experimental X-µCT data for realistic pore distributions and offers both CLI and GUI interfaces. Designed for researchers and engineers, the modular system allows swapping between data-driven and physics-based models to study process parameters and pore formation.

## Finding the Porosity Model

Once you open this click on **Share with me** and look for the tale named **"Porosity Model"** by Kacper Kowalik.

> **Important:** To access this tale in "Share with me," you need to request access from the author first.

The user can now use and run the GUI by passing the local files and parameters.

You can use example data by:
1. Clicking on **Load Example Case**
2. Using the drop down for **Import Material Library**

## Accessing Output Files

You can find the results in **Files tab** → **Tale Workspace** in the **output** folder. It will save the output for every run.
