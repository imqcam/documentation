# Enclave 1: Process Modeling Profile

```{note}
This profile is still under development.
```

The information provided in this profile is based on
{cite:ps}`Ramesh_Huffnagel_Gianoola_2022` and interviews with JHU team members.

The JHU Characterization seedling is focused on high-throughput approaches to
materials characterization with three distinct efforts:
* [High-throughput laser shock experiments](jhu-laser-shock)
* [High-throughput microstructural characterization](jhu-microstructure)
* [High-throughput nanoindentation](jhu-nanoindentation)

## Deliverables
The primary deliverables identified for this seedling are:
* full dataset of ...
* implementation of a workflows for ... 
* demonstration of composed workflows in DTE through challenge problems
