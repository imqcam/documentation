# IMQCAM Documentation

This public repository contains a [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/) for the IMQCAM Data Management platform.
It is automatically built into a Docker image using a GitHub Actions workflow.  The image
is pushed to a public DockerHub repository, deployed onto the IMQCAM K8s cluster with
[dockerhub-watcher](https://github.com/xarthisius/dockerhub-watcher), 
and made available at https://docs.imqcam.org. New commits made to the main branch will regenerate the live documentation.

To create a new compatible conda environment:
```
conda create -n imqcam_docs python=3.10
conda activate imqcam_docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To build locally:
```
jupyter-book build --all .
```

If you then open `_build/html/index.html` in your local browser you can preview the rendered result.

To build the Docker image locally:
```
docker build -t <org>/imqcam-docs .
