## Uploading and Downloading Data

The IMQCAM Data Portal is the central resource for you to find data from IMQCAM. Ddata is centralized here by automated, streaming upload from IMQCAM labs but you can also manually upload or download your data for your project. Note that twin data in the IMQCAM portal is read-only. That is, it is considered data of record and you cannot edit or otherwise modify the data files here. You have complete control, however, to modify metadata and you can create a derivative dataset that you hold here if you need to incorporate changes such as a new correction.
