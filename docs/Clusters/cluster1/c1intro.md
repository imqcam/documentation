# Cluster 1: Process Modeling Profile
```{note}
**This profile is still under development.**
```
## Overview

**Cluster1: Process Modeling** is responsible for activities that print, process, and characterize samples as well as simulation modeling that focuses on the printing and processing parameters. Cluster 1 guides the manufacturing process to understand its influence on the resulting material state. The outputs from this cluster serve as essential inputs for downstream modeling activities, particularly those in Cluster 2.

## Deliverables

The primary deliverables identified for this cluster, as inputs to Cluster 2, are **location-specific statistics related to microstructure and defects**, explicitly defined as a function of process parameters.

### Location-Specific Microstructural Statistics (Function of Process Parameters)

Distributions of key microstructural features:

- Grain size and volume fraction
- Grain shape
- Lath variant size and volume fraction
- Phase/precipitate morphology
- Correlation functions, such as grain-precipitate and lath variants
- Crystallographic orientation, misorientation, and micro texture

### Location-Specific Defect Statistics (Function of Process Parameters)

- Void volume distributions, shape, and sizes
- Void size versus number or volume frequency
- Delineation of pore density versus explicit representation in SERVEs (Statistically Equivalent RVEs)

## Data Sources

The data used within or generated by Cluster 1 arise from:

- **Printing (build) and processing groups** (principally at CMU)
- **Characterization groups** at CMU, CWRU, and Northwestern
- **Modeling groups** at CMU

Data sources include:

- Build and processing settings
- Experimental characterization of conditions during builds (e.g., synchrotron radiography of LBPF)
- Microstructure characterization (e.g., EBSD)
- Fatigue and tensile testing

## Builds

### Printer Information

- Print parameters
- Process parameters
- Build geometries

### Mechanical Testing

- Fatigue
- Tensile
- Coupon and parts are mentioned in relation to fatigue experiments and characterization

## Characterization

The source highlights several types of characterization that provide data inputs related to microstructure and defects, which are the outputs of Cluster 1.

### Mechanical Testing

- Fatigue mechanical tests
- Tensile experiment results
- Coupon and part geometries

### Microstructure Characterization

- Extracting statistics from experimental images
- EBSD (Electron Backscatter Diffraction) scans for high-resolution details

### Defect Characterization

- Characterization and correlations of defects
- Void distributions

### Fractography

### Process Design Modeling

Used within Cluster 1 to generate the microstructure and defect statistics as a function of process parameters. This includes **Thermocalc CALPHAD** and bespoke **IMQCAM** codes.

## Collaborating Groups

- **Rollett group:** Provides statistics of microstructure and defect characteristics, such as Aspect Ratio and Grain size distributions, and microstructural correlations.
- **Narra group:** Provides porosity density distributions and their evolution.
- **Oskay group:** Provides characterization and correlations of defects.
- **JHU-APL and Lewandowski group:** Provide statistics of microstructure & defect characteristics and perform fatigue experiments & characterization for coupon and parts.

These experiments likely generate the raw data from which the statistics are derived or inform the process-structure relationships.
